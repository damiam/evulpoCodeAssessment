# DEVS INTERVIEWEES TASK
Coding Task for Full Stack Developer at evulpo

# DESCRIPTION
In this git-hub repository you can find the directory `EVULPO_CAROUSEL` which contains the files with the solution of the coding task requested. To run this please use http-server. Note that my focus was on the functionality of the application and not the aesthetics.

The PDF file `evulpo_recommender.pdf` instead represents the conceptual solution for the recommender system which was requested in task 2.
